Add `runTests.sh`
----------------

Testing (and other processes) are handeled by a bash script `runTests.sh`, as it
is done in TYPO3 core. The following composer scripts have been removed:

*    `php-cs-fixer`

Features
========

Support for YAML-based configuration
------------------------------------

Role definitions can now be stored in YAML files as well. See
:ref:`section-configuration-roledefinition` for more information.

In the backend module, the export of `be_groups` supports YAML too.


Support for global configuration
--------------------------------

Role definitions can now be stored in the global `config` directory. See
:ref:`section-configuration-roledefinition` for more information.


Download role definitions export as file
----------------------------------------

Role definitions exports can now be downloaded as YAML or PHP file.


Deprecations
============

Role definitions file name
--------------------------

The use of the role definition file `Configuration/RoleDefinitions.php` is
deprecated an will be removed in v3. Use
`Configuration/BackendRoleDefinitions.php` instead, or the newly introduced
possibility of global role definitions in `config/BackendRoleDefinitions.yaml`
or `config/BackendRoleDefinitions.php`.
